# Python-Learning
## Preface
* Trying hard to acquire this language which means a lot to me...
* Feel resolved to get assess to another way of thinking and address issues.

*A special thanks here to my boy Peter for guidance and companion!*

# Learning process update:

## 2020.2.3 
### Peter's Tutorial
1. basic grammar
2. data types[int & float & str][list & tuple & dict]
3. condition control statement [if] & loop statement [for & while]
4. function 
5. manage to understand the recursion (feels good about it)

### Confusion:
1. the usage of command "return"
2. command "input" & "print"

## 2020.2.6 
### My Gains:
1. the execution of function won't imple unless its invoking
2. command "return" serves as a role of going back to the function for implement/terminate the implement of function/return to multiple values and putting them into a tuple.

Thanks for follow a noob of Python and witness my progress in python!
