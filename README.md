# Python-Learning
## Preface
* Getting to the assess of this language which means a lot to me...
* As a business student,all I want to acquire is to break out my zone for there are lot of neophilia waiting for me to acknowledge.
* Being accustomed to analysis the problem or issue oriented by process due to my major background,i feel obliged to adapt to another way of thinking and address issues.I was like,ooh,so resolved to weight my competence.Programming，for me，has become like a mantra:"Open sesame".

*A special thanks here to my boy Peter for guidance and companion!luv u always.*

# Learning process update:

## 2020.2.3 
### Peter's Tutorial
1. basic grammar
2. data types[int & float & str][list & tuple & dict]
3. condition control statement [if] & loop statement [for & while]
4. function 
5. manage to understand the recursion (feels good about it)

### Confusion:
1. the usage of command "return"
2. command "input" & "print"

## 2020.2.6 
### My Gains:
1. the execution of function won't imple unless its invoking
2. command "return" serves as a role of going back to the function for implement/terminate the implement of function/return to multiple values and putting them into a tuple.

## Epilogue
Thanks for following a noob of Python and witnessing my progress in python!
I would never fail to hold the drive for it!
